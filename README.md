## Executive Summary
The HR Requests Tracker shows a **high-volume, high-closure HR operation** supporting a workforce of **362 employees**, with **4,796 total requests processed**. While overall closure performance is strong, request concentration in specific categories and departments highlights clear opportunities for **process optimization and workload balancing**.

## Overall Request Status (Operational Health)
- **Closed:** 3,323 requests (~69% of total)
- **Pending:** 1,229 requests (~26%)
- **Declined:** 235 requests (~5%)
- **In Progress:** 9 requests (<1%)

**Insight:**  
The low number of *In Progress* requests suggests efficient processing once work begins. However, the relatively high pending volume indicates a **front-end bottleneck**, likely at the review, approval, or documentation stage.

## Request Categories (Employee Demand Drivers)
Top request categories:
1. **Benefits & Welfare – 1,768 requests**
2. **Payroll – 1,003 requests**
3. **Leave – 798 requests**

Other categories include Onboarding, Compliance, Appraisal, and Miscellaneous requests.

**Insight:**  
Over **70% of requests** are concentrated in Benefits, Payroll, and Leave, highlighting that employee needs are primarily linked to compensation, welfare, and time-off management.

**Opportunity:**
- Introduce clearer self-service guidance
- Automate recurring payroll and leave requests
- Reduce repeat queries through policy documentation or FAQs

---

## Requests by Department (Workload Distribution)
Departments with the highest HR request volumes:
- **Operations – 1,063**
- **Strategy – 913**
- **Security – 678**
- **Technology – 582**

Lower-volume departments include Finance, Data, Human Resources, and Product.

**Insight:**  
Operationally intensive teams generate the most HR interactions, likely due to workforce size, shift patterns, or role complexity.

**Action:**
- Align HR business partners more closely with high-demand departments
- Proactively address department-specific HR issues

---

## Requests Over Time (Trend Analysis)
- Stable request volumes throughout 2023
- Significant increase in early–mid 2024
- Sharp decline from January 2025 onward

**Insight:**  
The 2024 spike may reflect organizational change such as growth, restructuring, audits, or policy updates. The sustained decline in 2025 may indicate process improvements, reduced activity, or changes in system usage.

**Action:**  
Validate whether the 2025 drop reflects genuine efficiency gains or under-reporting.

---

## Key Risks and Improvement Areas
- Pending requests (26%) may impact employee experience if not addressed
- High reliance on HR for transactional issues increases operational load
- Uneven departmental demand can strain HR responsiveness

---

## Management Takeaways
- HR demonstrates strong execution once requests are in progress
- Most demand is predictable and suitable for automation
- Data supports further investment in self-service and workflow optimization

---

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Track **pending request aging** and SLA compliance
2. Automate Benefits, Payroll, and Leave processes
3. Assign focused HR support to Operations and Strategy teams
4. Investigate and validate the 2025 request volume decline

---

## Key KPIs & SLA Targets (Suggested)
- **Overall Closure Rate:** ≥ 75%
- **Pending Requests (Backlog):** ≤ 15% of total requests
- **Average Resolution Time:** 3–5 business days
